Git fetch will sync all remote branch to your local bookmark branch (origin/master, origin/A ...)
then you can merge from there.


git rebase -i head~3
change pick to squash, then it will be combined to previous commit(pick)

git diff master
it will make a diff between the latest master and your last commit of current branch

to see a diff between the common ancestor where you original fork from master and the last commit of your branch.
git merge-base contrib master
821y90abc2
git diff 821

this is equivalent to: git diff master...topic

cherry-pick in git is like a rebase for a single commit. it takes the patch that was introduced in a commit and tried to
reapply it on the branch you are currently on. this is useful if you have a number of commits on a topic branch and only
want to integrate one of them.
