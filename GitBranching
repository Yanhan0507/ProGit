HEAD points to the current branch and current commit.

                    666 <= master
                    |
98ca8 <= 421ab <= 333 <= 789
                          |
                          test branch
git checkout -b test at 333, and then make a new change 789.
and then someone made a change 666 at master. so two branch divert.

you have to switch to master (before switch, you can consider to commit your current change),
becoz switch would restore anything to the target branch. 

from master, you can run a git merge test
if there is any merge conflict, deal with them, and add these files, and then commit. then this commit is a common child of both 666
and 789 and at the end of master branch.
then you can delelte test branch.
